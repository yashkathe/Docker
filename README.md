# Docker & Kubernetes

## What is Docker ?

Docker is a tool that helps developers package up an application with everything it needs, like libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. This makes it easy to run the application reliably in different computing environments.

## What is an image ?

In Docker, an image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software: code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. Images are used to create containers, which are isolated environments where the software runs.

## What is a container ?

A container is a lightweight, stand-alone package that contains everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system settings. Containers isolate software from its environment and from other containers, ensuring that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging environments.

## What is Kuberentes ?

Kubernetes is an open-source platform used to automate deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications. It helps ensure that applications run smoothly by handling tasks like load balancing, scaling, and failover, making it easier to manage complex, distributed systems.
