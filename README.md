# Docker

Docker is a tool that helps developers package up an application with everything it needs, like libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. This makes it easy to run the application reliably in different computing environments.

## What is a container ?

A container is a lightweight, stand-alone package that contains everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system settings. Containers isolate software from its environment and from other containers, ensuring that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging environments.
